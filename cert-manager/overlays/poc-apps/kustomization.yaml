# Note: Do NOT set namespace here. Resources have explicit namespaces:
# - ClusterIssuer: cluster-scoped (for reference, certificates are synced from rancher-manager)
# - configmap: kube-system (references secret synced from rancher-manager)
#
# Certificates are NOT requested on this cluster. TLS secrets are synced from
# rancher-manager cluster via scripts/sync-certs-from-rancher-manager.sh
# This reduces Let's Encrypt certificate requests (1 source cluster vs 4).
resources:
  # ClusterIssuer (for reference, not used for new certificate requests)
  - clusterissuer.yaml
  # ConfigMap for nginx-ingress default SSL cert (references synced secret)
  - configmap-default-cert.yaml
  # Note: Fleet Bundle targeting is handled by GitRepo spec.targets
  # The fleet.yaml Bundle resource is not needed - Fleet auto-creates bundles from GitRepos

# Patch nginx-ingress DaemonSet to add --default-ssl-certificate flag
# This is required for RKE2 (see GitHub issue #1408)
# The flag must be set as a command-line argument, not just in ConfigMap
# Note: Fleet/Kustomize may not be able to patch RKE2-managed DaemonSets.
# If patch fails, apply manually: see README.md for instructions
