# Note: Do NOT set namespace here. Resources have explicit namespaces:
# - ClusterIssuer: cluster-scoped
# - wildcard certs: cert-manager
# - default-ingress cert + configmap: kube-system (avoids conflict with wildcard-dataknife-net secretName)
#
# This is the ONLY cluster that requests certificates from Let's Encrypt.
# TLS secrets are synced to downstream clusters via scripts/sync-certs-from-rancher-manager.sh
# This reduces Let's Encrypt certificate requests from 8 (4 clusters × 2 certs) to just 2.
